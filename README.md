# Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship – Project Phase

This repository contains two completed data analysis projects developed as part of the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship (Project Phase).
Each project focuses on solving a real-world business problem using data analysis, visualization, and basic predictive modeling.

## The goal of these projects is to demonstrate:

- structured exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- clear business thinking
- simple, interpretable models
- actionable insights and recommendations

## Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Industry
Problem Statement

Telecom companies face revenue loss when customers stop using their services (customer churn).
The objective of this project was to identify patterns and factors associated with customer churn.

What was done:

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior
- Compared churned vs non-churned customers across multiple features
- Used logistic regression to understand feature influence on churn
- Interpreted model coefficients to identify risk factors

Key Focus:

- Understanding why customers leave
- Translating data patterns into business-friendly insights
- Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

## Project 2: Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction
Problem Statement

Missed medical appointments lead to wasted resources, longer wait times, and operational inefficiencies.
The objective of this project was to analyze no-show behavior and identify factors associated with missed appointments.

What was done:

- Cleaned and prepared healthcare appointment data
- Conducted exploratory analysis on:
  - age
  - waiting days
  - SMS reminders
  - appointment timing
- Created age groups to analyze no-show rates more clearly
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to identify important features
- Built a Power BI dashboard for stakeholder-friendly insights

Key Insights:

- Longer waiting periods are strongly associated with higher no-show rates
- Certain age groups are more prone to missing appointments
- SMS reminders show a relationship with improved attendance
- Feature importance highlights what mattered most for predictions (not causality)

Tools Used:

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Data visualization and business analysis techniques
